# Digit Recognizer

This is a simple neural network classifier implemented in Python using NumPy. The neural network is designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Program Overview
The program consists of the following components:

- Data Loading: The MNIST dataset is loaded using pandas and preprocessed.
- Neural Network Architecture: A simple neural network with one hidden layer is implemented.
- Training: The neural network is trained using gradient descent and backpropagation.
- Prediction: Trained model is used to make predictions on test data

## Code Structure
Project1.ipynb: Main Python script containing the neural network implementation.
train.csv: Training data (MNIST dataset).
## Parameters
Iterations: The number of iterations for training the neural network.
Learning Rate (alpha): The step size in the gradient descent algorithm.
## Results
The program prints the accuracy of the model during training and provides visualizations of predictions on a few training examples.
